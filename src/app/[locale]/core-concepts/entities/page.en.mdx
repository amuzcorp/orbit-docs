# Entities

Entities are the core business objects in your application. They represent the main concepts and data structures that your application works with.

## Key Features

- **Identity**: Each entity has a unique identifier
- **Properties**: Define the characteristics of the entity
- **Behavior**: Define how the entity interacts with other entities
- **Lifecycle**: Manage the entity's state throughout its existence

## Example

```typescript
// Example entity definition
interface ProductEntity {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  category: string;
  stock: number;
  
  // Methods
  updateStock(quantity: number): void;
  isInStock(): boolean;
  calculateDiscount(percentage: number): number;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep entities focused on business logic
2. Implement proper validation
3. Use appropriate design patterns
4. Maintain clear boundaries between entities
